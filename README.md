**🚀 Getting Started**

_Prerequisites_

Rust and Cargo installed on your system
Git for cloning the repository
Base testnet or mainnet access

_Running a Challenge_

1. Navigate to any challenge directory
     cd folder-name    # Replace folder-name with the topic you want to check

2. Build and run the project:
    cargo build
    cargo run

**🔑 API Configuration**
These challenges interact with Base network. You'll need API keys for:
Base RPC Endpoints

Mainnet: https://mainnet.base.org
Testnet: https://goerli.base.org

Setting Up API Keys

Create a .env file in the challenge directory
Add your configuration:

BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://goerli.base.org
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key  # For sending transactions

**💰 Network Configuration**
Base network details:

Network Name: Base
Chain ID: 8453
Currency Symbol: ETH
Block Explorer: https://basescan.org
